            Our soil is not healthy!
            All over the world, our soil is becoming less and less able to sustain life.
            It is losing its ability to store water and store carbon.
            It is being washed away, poisoned and turned into desert.
        </h2>

        <h3>Why Do We Need to Save the Soil?</h3>

        <h3> Eighty-seven percent of life forms on this planet –
            microbes, worms, insects, birds, animals, human beings, plants, trees and
            every other vegetation on the planet is sustained by an average of thirty-nine inches of topsoil.
            And that is in grave danger right now. In the last forty years,
            forty percent of the world’s top soil has been lost.
            The United Nations says we have soil left only for approximately eighty to hundred harvests,
            which means another forty-five to sixty years of agriculture.
            After that, we will not have the soil to produce food.
            You can imagine the suffering that we will unfold in the world.
            Thirty percent of India’s land is already degraded,
            and 90% of India’s states are seeing soil turn to desert.
            That means nothing can be cultivated there.
            So, protecting the soil for the future generations of this land is the most important thing.
